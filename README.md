# For those who need PRIVACY
anonBOOT is a tool designed to edit system settings and optimize privacy. It's designed for those who want anonymity but enjoy using Windows.

This app alone will not hide your identity but should be used in conjunction with other  methods such as a VPN, etc. depending on the level of security you need.

This app does provide a clean interface to toggle privacy sensitive settings across Windows services, registry values, networking components, and system features.

## Administrator Privileges Required
anonBOOT must be run as Administrator.

This is not optional. The application modifies:
- Windows Registry keys
- System services
- Firewall and networking rules
- OS level privacy settings

If the app is launched without Administrator privileges, it won't run.



## Goals
anonBOOT does not claim to make you anonymous.  
It helps reduce unnecessary exposure and puts control of obscure, buried settings back into the user’s hands.

- Centralize relevant settings
- Reduce accidental data leaks
- Make privacy tradeoffs visible
- Transparent and auditable (Open source)
